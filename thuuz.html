                                <p class="section-content">In 2018, I was assigned a project to redesign a mobile app. We decided to redesign Thuuz, a mobile sports app that displays highlights and scores for games. The application was redesigned based off the data found through our user research, which suggested the application was providing users with an unsatisfactory experience. Interviews and surveys were conducted to further understand our target users and the role of sports and technology in their lives. Usability tasks were conducted on the target users to evaluate and determine the pain points of Thuuz’s current interface. The results of these tasks were used in the redesign process, in which we evaluated the pain points to establish redesign targets to alleviate some of those issues.</p>

                                    <p>We want to make the Thuuz app clearer so that users understand what they are looking at in the moment, rather than struggling to understand. The excitement scores and game information should be easily distinguished by the user. The ESPN app does a better job at doing so than Thuuz. When showing scores, ESPN adds the team logo next to the name in order to make them recognizable to users in addition to fading out the name of the losing team. Thuuz just has the names and scores placed next to each other, forcing users to look closely and carefully. The excitement score is also next to the game but gives no indication of it being an excitement score.</p>

                                <p>ESPN and Thuuz are both sports mobile applications that place a large emphasis on being able to allow users to watch games live. In order to watch live games, the apps have users sign in with their TV providers and will be given notifications for games they are interested in watching. The two apps are similar in terms of their sign in processes: when users first create an account, they can choose teams from different sports to ‘Like’ and then get news and updates regarding these teams. Both apps show scores from live and previous games as well. The ESPN app provides a wider range of functionalities compared to the Thuuz app. Users can read news articles and watch highlight clips from games, listen to podcasts, and check team rankings and scores. Thuuz, on the other hand, solely focuses more on the excitement score, along with scores from games.</p>

                                  <p>As the official website for the NBA, nba.com serves as the largest information platform for the NBA. The website specifically faces the audiences who watch NBA basketball games, and it covers holistic information relating to the NBA league. In contrast to the general sports information in Thuuz, the NBA official website mainly concentrates on the basketball leagues and satisfy the users who are interested in the NBA games. However, Thuuz can solve one of the issues that the NBA official website cannot, which is helping people efficiently spend time by notifying them of the most exciting points during games.</p>

                              <p>The NBA official website offers comprehensive information about the NBA. The major function is to help people who watch NBA have a complete experience. Before each game, the user can watch the previous matchups of two teams, view each player’s status, and read the pregame reports. During the game, the user can switch to live streaming to watch the game or check the play-by-play updates. After the game, the website offers a game summary, highlight replays, and various interviews. In addition, the website has an online shopping feature named “e-shop” to let fans purchase souvenirs. Compared with the NBA official website, Thuuz focuses on presenting live games. It allows the users to know when they should watch the games, rather than staying on the webpage and watch the complete game.</p>

                            <p>The users that we are primarily targeting are sports fans or people that pay attention to sporting events in general. We expected users in our study to range from 18‐40 years old, the ideal range for students and working professionals. It is around these ages that people have less time to focus on hobbies (in this case sporting events) due to school or jobs. Due to this lack of time, they need to put in effort to create time to keep up with game scores and team news. Our ideal users will try to remedy this issue by finding ways to get news and updates in a quick and clear manner, primarily trying to find information on the sport/team/game they are interested in.</p>
                          <p>In order to find more information on the type of user that would use the Thuuz mobile app, our team conducted ten interviews, as well and sent out a survey hosted on Google Forms. We then compiled and analyzed the information to find what users want and expect from sports, mobile apps, and more.</p>

                                    <p>Over the course of one week, our team was able to interview ten people. The interviewees were selected from team members’ friends, family and acquaintances. The only requirement we had for our interviewees was to have some kind of exposure to sports in the past decade. Once selected, two team members conducted the interview, one acting as note‐taker and the other as facilitator. Our interviews were structured to be about 25‐35 minutes long, with ten key questions and one free‐form question at the end. Team members followed an interview protocol, first asking interviewees to read and sign a consent form. Afterwards we made small talk with the interviewee before getting into the official questions. These questions ranged from broad inquiries about their relationship to sports, their sports viewing patterns, their technology use patterns and more. The interviews were semi‐structured, team members followed the questions on the protocol, but could also inquire more depending on the answers provided.</p>

                                  <p>We found that many of our participants do not believe that their responsibilities get in the way of them watching/enjoying sports. This finding contradicted our team’s initial hypothesis that people struggle to find time to stay up‐to‐date with sports news. When it came to participants’ live game habits, we learned that a few of them had difficulty watching games live due to interferences, some only had an interest in the highlights, and others did not have the capacity to watch a full game or don’t think watching the entire game is a necessity. Along with their stance on live games, we asked participants if they have ever experienced “Fear of Missing Out” (FOMO) in regards to sports. About half of the participants stated that they have experienced FOMO, saying that they dislike missing major games or championships.</p>
                                  <p>After getting information about the participants’ sports habits, we received information on their social media/technology habits. We found that when participants miss a game or want to stay up‐to‐date with sports, they mainly utilize TV channels and mobile apps to acquire information. Along with sports‐related apps, several participants stated that they use social media platforms to find sports news. They used the “Now Trending” sections to see what other people have to say about games. In addition, participants used group messaging apps (such as Facebook Messenger) to share thoughts and news with friends and family.</p>
                                  <p>In regards to sports‐related apps, our team was interested in how satisfied users are with their services, what they wished could be improved and how much time they spent on the application. Many of our participants using these apps thought they were fast and easy to use. They enjoy being able to “Favorite” their favorite teams and keep track of them. Being able to receive quick live updates, stats and highlights are also all desirable. Participants also expressed a need to get information as quickly as possible and to filter out any unnecessary information. They like apps that are more customizable to their interests. When it came to the time spent on the apps, many of our participants revealed to be on the apps for more than 15 minutes.</p>
                                  <p>The information we gathered from our participants allowed us to reevaluate our target audience and start thinking of ways to create a redesign that fits the needs and characteristics of our audience.</p>

                              <p>During the usability test, we followed the “think‐aloud protocol" that enables users to explain what they are doing as they go. While users were doing the usability test, we recorded their thoughts, actions, and reactions. For each test participants, we summarized his/her usability metrics. Our team extracted and categorized the usability issues from documents. The identification of such issues can support our team to design a better user interface for Thuuz.</p>

                                      <p>One of the biggest problems that Thuuz has is about visibility ‐ it simply fails to provide an adequate amount of communication between the user and in‐app elements. Specifically, very few reasons or justifications are provided when the user is asked to complete certain actions, and not enough response is displayed after the users’ actions.</p>

                                        <p>In terms of presenting different elements in the application, the placement of buttons and selection of typography are also negatively influencing the user experience of Thuuz.

                                            <p>One of the most noticeable problems with the Thuuz mobile app experience is its inability to efficiently organize information in a manner that does not overwhelm users. Each interface view does a poor job of avoiding unnecessary information. This problem is only enhanced by unnecessary layers in the application that lead to additional views.</p>

                                        <p>Our redesign process for Thuuz’s iOS application is mainly based on the pain points that we discovered during the identification of usability issues. As a result, here is a list of high‐level goals that we are attempting to achieve with our redesign:</p>  
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                  </div>

                                  </div>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
                          <div>
                              <h4 class="sub-section-title">Design Targets</h2>
                                <p>Our suggested redesign only covers several sections of the current application due to time and resource constraints. The chosen sections are based on the how frequently the feature would be accessed and how crucial it is to include the section so that the experience can be effectively visualized. The sections that we included in our redesign prototypes were Home/"Feed", Game Details, Search, Profile/"Me", Sports and Setup/Help</p>
                                <p>We decided a few key features, interaction schemes and visual elements that our redesigns should have in our team meeting:</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                      </div>

                            <br>

                                      <p>The new home page now features a clean and elegant card‐like design. Each page can display at most 1 game at any given time, and the card representing the game now shows a video or an image of the game as the center of visual attention. On the bottom right corner is the new navigation button. The user can tap on an icon to proceed to the corresponding page of the application, or tap any blank area to collapse the menu.</p>

                                  </div>

                                  <p>Tapping on the card of any game brings the user into the game details page. The new game details page not only shows more information, but also presents it in a more appealing and efficient way. The video/image of the game and the graph showing the flow of the game’s real‐time excitement score dominates the page, which ensures that the user would receive the most relevant information in the shortest amount of time.</p>

                              </div>

                              <p>The search page is an entirely new feature incorporated into the application. It allows the user to search for teams, leagues, games and other types of information across multiple sections of the application, so that the user can reach more fine‐grained targets quickly. Users do not have to enter entire key words to make a query, the application would automatically suggect the most relevant results by each section.</p>

                    <div class="row justify-content-center">

                            <h4 class="sub-section-title" style="font-style: italic; text-transform: none; margin-top: 25px" >"Me" & Sports Pages</h4>
                          <p>The redesigned “Me” page essentially replaces the “profile” page in the original application. The user may manage the account, configure team preferences, setup notification settings and change the TV provider information on this page. The navigation button is still located at the bottom‐right corner for easy access.</p>
                          <p>Another addition to the application is the new Sports page. It displays news, player information, games and other highlights separated by different kinds of sports.</p>
                          </div>
                      </div>

                        <div class="col-md-4">

                              <p>The new setup pages utilizes a new design philosophy. The application shows one key feature of the application with a minimalistic graph and a short textual description. Different key features are organized horizontally and can be switched by swiping. The user has the option to skip at any time by tapping on the “Get Started” button.</p>

                                                        <p>In order to be competitive in a crowded space such as sports technology, applications nowadays need to have an x‐factor that separates the product from the rest. Thuuz has this with their proprietary technology, and they have proven it with other products. However, their iOS mobile app has failed to meet the standard that they have set with these products. Using industry standard user research methods and expert interface assessments, we were able to evaluate and identify major usability issues and provide redesign wireframes that correspond to these findings.</p>
                                                        <p>We used a variety of diffferent research and testing methods in order to determine the application's major faults. By using surveys and interviews, we were able to create affinity diagrams that allowed a better understanding of our users' demographics and their needs. This, as well as the results discovered during usibility tests are what guided are redesign and allowed us to highlight the major points that needed asssistance. By focusing on these points, we designed a more user-friendly version of THUUZ that also highlighted the app's most prominent featture: the excitement score.</p>
                                                        <p>While the wireframes created are far from a final product, and given the constraints of this project, there are certainly areas that need improvement within the redesigns. However, the end‐product delivery is a reflection of user based research along with the application of standard human‐computer interaction guidelines, which can serve as building blocks for future redesigns.</p>
