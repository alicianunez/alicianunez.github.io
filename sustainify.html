                              <p>During a 10 week course, me and five other students were given the task to create a mobile application based off of a social, econimcal, or environmental issue. Our team focused on the harmful effects fast fashion has on the environment and created an app that provides sustainable and ethical options, as well as educates users about the consequences of fast fashion. Using a an agile development process, our researched, designed, and developed a working protoype for our sustainable clothing app Sustainify. </p>

                                  <h4 class="sub-section-title">The Problem</h2>
                                  <p>According to Quantis, the fashion industry was responsible for the emission of 3,990 million tons of CO2 in 2018, making it the second most polluting industry in the world after the oil industry. Many people mindlessly buy clothes from fast fashion companies without knowing the effects that this seemingly harmless action can have on climate change. The average consumer also bought 60% more clothing in 2014 than in 2000, but they keep each garment for half as long.</p>

                                    <p>Our goal is to educate consumers on sustainability and divert fast fasion purchases to more sustainable alternatives in an approachable and friendly manner. This is where Sustainify comes in. Sustainify gives customers digestable facts about sustainabilty and how it correlates with climate change. The app has the user take a picture of an article of clothing and it will then use AI technology to scan the item and recommend a more eco-friendly option from our database of sustainable clothing brands.</p>

                            <p>For the first research method, we went out to interview people who were close to our target audience. Because it was difficult to find people who were really passionate about sustainability and climate change, we mostly interviewed people who were in the young adult age group and shop often. The interview consisted of two parts. The first part was to understand our participant better in terms of whether or not they care about sustainability and climate change. The second part dived into our actual prototype; we wanted to see how effective our introductory slides were because we got mixed feedback from our first prototype user testing that we conducted. We followed the interview structure that we learned from previous Informatics classes that we’ve taken in addition to the things we learned in Informatics 134. We also used this website as a reference: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/how-to-conduct-user-interviews</p>
                            <p>We were able to have four total interview participants. Each of us sat down with our respective participant and conducted the interview with the script that we produced beforehand. We then wrote down their answers and wrote down any interesting findings. The interviews averaged around 10-15 mins for each. </p>

If we found that more than one participant had similar responses on a question, we’d further discuss it and make necessary changes to our prototype.

                                        <p>From conducting interviews, a few of the participants mentioned that our introductory slides didn’t explicitly mention anything about climate change, we only talk about sustainability. It may not be obvious that being sustainable correlates with climate change. This supports our prototype testing decision to change our introductory slides so that it better informs our users. Our interviewees believe in climate change but not all of them practice sustainability. We also found that the majority of the interview participants are very price-conscious; they wouldn’t be comfortable paying too much for clothes that are sustainable. This could possibly be because our interviewees are all young adults in college. This finding supports our decision to change the ordering of products by lowest to highest. </p>

                                <p>We came up with a list of questions for our survey and after discussing which ones would be most beneficial for the actual survey, we created the actual survey using Google Forms. We separated the questions into three sections: demographics, climate change, and fashion/shopping. The questions we asked would help us better understand our audience/users. After creating the survey on Google Forms, each team member sent out the survey so it can reach a large audience. We relied on our knowledge from past Informatics classes and we used this website as a reference: https://zapier.com/learn/forms-surveys/writing-effective-survey/</p>

                            <p>After analyzing our results, we found that the majority of our participants feel like they have a good amount of knowledge about what climate change is with most of the rankings falling in the range of 2-4 out of a 5 point scale. Only four people ranked their knowledge of climate change at a 5 (indicating that they are very knowledgeable about the topic). With this information, we are able to safely assume that most people have at least heard about climate change and know the basics of this so our introductory slides do not have to go into a large amount of detail. Similar results were found when we asked our participants if they were familiar with the concept of sustainability. Another useful finding we discovered was that the majority of our participants ranked that they believe climate change is an important topic (3-5 out of a 5 point scale) with 5 being the most popular ranking. This is good news for us because that means most people seem to care about climate change, which most likely means that they are interested in taking action and that is the target of our app. We also found that even though most people are aware of sustainability and its effects on climate change, they still consider price to be the number one factor when they’re shopping. A lot of our participants indicated that even though they know it’s bad for the environment, they still opt for the cheaper option when they are shopping for clothes. We definitely have to keep this into consideration when showing the sustainable alternatives in our app. </p>

We wanted to gain better insight on how prospective users may use the app, improve design of the application so that it is effective and understandable for all, and clear up any confusion users may have on the app.</p>

                                  <p>We did a lot of research on sustainability and climate change. We also looked around to see if there were similar apps already on the market so we could get inspiration from them. From there, we discussed the vision of our app and the designers made the vision come to life through our prototypes. We also did research on any APIs, programming languages, etc. that could help us implement this scanning feature of our app. Looking through our prototype we determined specific tasks that a user may wish to perform while using the app. We asked testing participants to carry out these tasks on the prototype and to verbally describe what they are doing and the reasoning behind their actions. During the whole process, the facilitator would record any interesting findings. If a testing participant got stuck or were confused about a task, the facilitator will provide hints.</p>

                                    <p>We read through our findings and discussed them as a group. Some consistent findings we found were that our sustainability statistics were a bit confusing, our introduction slides needed to relate climate change to sustainability, and our participants preferred the feature of having a price filter so they can filter the recommendations to show the cheapest items first. We also found that a lot of our participants thought our introduction slides were too long and a few of them actually just skipped through all of it without reading. Many of our participants were confused by the metrics that were given for each brand sustainability profile. Our prototype had measures of animal, environment, and labor. Participants were confused what these metrics meant.</p>

                                      <p>We used the website Marvel to create a working prototype. We went with a green color scheme since our app focused on reducing climate change by being more sustainable. We took inspiration from other clothing apps, as well as the app GoodOnYou which focuses on brands' ethical and sustainable ratings. This is why we made sure to include brand and item pages, as well as a closet to save desired items. A main goal of ours was to create an easy to navigate and understandable app that allows users to find sustainable recommendations.</p>
                                      <p>When it came to creating a functioning application, we decided to use ReactNative as our framework. Some of our members have had past experience using this framework so we decided it would be in our best interest to use it. We also use the Clarifai and ShopStyle APIs which allowed us to use AI to identify scanned clothing items and then find items similar to them.</p>

                                <p>When users select "Scan an Item", the app will open up the camera feature so users can take a picture of the item they want to scan.</p>

                            <p>Once the app has searched through the database, the user will be presented with a list of different sustainable options that resemble the clothing item. Users can select an item and be redirected to a product page to learn more. The heart icon on the top right corner allows users to save the item to their "closet", which can be accessed from the bottom bar and from the homescreen.</p>

                        <p>Users can search through a list of brands to learn whether or not they are sustainable. Brand pages will present users with information of the brand, including ethical ratings regarding their impact on the environment.</p>

                                                      <p>We started off with the topic of climate change and artificial intelligence and the idea of helping consumers be more sustainable. This idea then expanded to providing people a means to sustainable fashion and educating them about what climate change is and how being sustainable can help. We began with very simple paper prototypes that later became low-fidelity prototypes. After conducting user testing, we made necessary changes that transferred across to our high-fidelity prototypes. Some major changes that resulted from our findings included the option to filter the sustainable alternatives by price and to explain more about how climate change and sustainability are linked together in our introductory slides. </p>
                                                      <p>In terms of the back end, we were able to develop the application through weekly sprints. We had some trouble implementing some of the APIs in the beginning and this mainly had to do with the fact that this is the first time some of us have worked with the APIs that we chose to use (ShopStyle, Clarifai, etc.). However, we were able to meet regularly and practice pair programming which significantly helped move along the development process. Designing the pages was made easy through the use of Marvel’s hand-off functionality, which allowed us to easily translate the prototypes into our actual implementation. Due to the learning curve of the APIs, we were not able to incorporate a few of our findings from our research such as allowing the users to filter the alternatives by price. We hope to be able to implement this feature in the future as well as fix minor bugs such as the navigation bar not showing up on every page of our app.</p>
