Our app used AI and facial recognition in order to scan the faces of political pundits and figures in order to provide information regarding these targets. The app was created entirely from scratch using platforms and APIs that were new to all of us. This project allowed me to collaborated with a team while working closely with sponsors who gave us requirements and feedback to create the perfect app for them.</p>

However, how much of these comments are influenced by outsider sources? There is a lack of transparency between political pundits and the public when it comes to endorsements and the way it influences what they say to public masses.</p>

Users will now be able to understand why pundits endorse certain causes, organizations and figures by scanning their faces.</p>

We held weekly meetings with our sponsors to give updates and recieve feedback for our app. A requirements document was created outlining the different functional and nonfunctional requirements our sponsors wished for the app to have. We referenced the document constantly in order to ensure an app that reflected our sponsors' needs. The document also allowed us to design the software that lead to the basis of our app.</p>

                                <p>For our research, we decided to interview people over the age of 45 who live in the Southern California area.  Due to us working with a UCI professor, we contacted the school’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) to make sure our protocol followed IRB guidelines when interviewing. This included a mandatory informed consent script read to participants before the interview. The purpose of this study was to gather information that would be useful in bettering the News X-Ray mobile application. </p>
                                <p>The procedure involved a 10 minute interview and a 15 minute user testing of the mobile application. The interview consisted of questions regarding participant habits on app usage, news consumption and political engagement. The user testing portion of the study had participants use News X-Ray on a prepared news clip followed by questions about their experience with the app. The interview and testing should have taken no longer than 20-30 minutes and all information was kept confidential and anonymous.</p>
                                <p>As these interviews were conducted near the end of our 20 weeks with a mostly completed app, our team was only able to gather a handful of interviews for our study. We aimed for one interview from each team member and logged our findings into a shared folder which we later analyzed.</p>

                              <h4 class="sub-section-title">Findings</h2>
                                <p>Based on the answers we received from our interviews, we realized that our subjects consumed their news through through a variety of different channels and at varying levels of consumptions (some subjects seeing the news everyday and some only rarely). Despite the differences in some answers, all subjects agreed that politics were very important to their life. There was also similarities in the subjects’ political leanings, with every almost all identifying as a liberal or a moderate. We believe this also influenced their answer of Fox News being the most unfair news source, while stating the CNN and BBC are the most fair. Our team acknowledged that our subjects did not represent a diverse range of political affiliations, and made sure to take note of that so as to not make a mistake in solely aiming for this to be our target audience. We want people from all types of backgrounds and political affiliations to be able to use our app. These results, however, did allow us take into consideration the importance of being as unbiased as possible.</p>
                                <p>The user testing portion of our app, had our subjects answer a couple of open-ended questions after completing tasks using the app on a prepared news clip. Our team received some positive responses when asked if the app improved the subjects’ experience watching the clip. They all agreed that the app gave them more context regarding the clip because it provided some background information on the speakers, as well as ideas as to what their “true motive” may be. This correlates to what they believed was the app’s strengths: transparency, as well as simplicity (in regards to the UI design). In regards to the app’s weaknesses, subjects noted the lack of current information on the app which our team expected due to the app being new and still in prototype stages. When asked for suggestions regarding the app, some subjects requested more personal background information for the targets.</p>

If yes, the user is able to provide information for the target and submit it. The information will be sent to our database, where it awaits verification and approval from admins.</p>

                                                              <p>Working on this project gave me the opportunity to have some real life experience with developing an app from scratch and working with a team. I was able to work closely with sponsors during our requirements gathering at the beginning of the project, which allowed me to create detailed documents outlining what the app will look like, how it will work, who will use it, and more. Having this information was crucial for our development team as we would refer back to it during our 20 weeks, as well as working closely with our sponsors through an agile development process that had us constantly creating, testing and receiving feedback each week. The agile process was a bit challenging at first, but as I grew more confident and comfortable, I learned how to work with my team together and also separately. As the weeks went by quickly and demanded constant updates, it was crucial for me to be able to prepare any necessary work that was assigned to me in order to then collaborate with the team during our meetings.</p>
                                                              <p>I was able to work on the UI and UX from scratch, starting with simple hand drawn sketches based off of our sponsors’ requirements. We then used user stories and personas to get a better understanding of how we would expect users to engage with the app. These methods were helpful for us and fueled our high fidelity prototypes which we made using Adobe XD. We were then able to bring these designs to life using React Native, a framework that was new to all of us, but we were able to learn and use along the way. React Native gave us the tools to develop and tie together the front-end of the app to the back-end facial recognition API and database where we stored all of our pundits and information. </p>
