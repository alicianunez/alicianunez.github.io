                                <p>I'm Alicia, a UX and UI designer with an interest in dabbling with front-end development. I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a degree in Human-Computer Interaction and a minor in Linguistics.</p>
                                <p>I have a passion for puzzle solving and creating user-friendly and intuitive technology.</p>
                                <p>I believe design is a collaborative effort. Its a result of communication and adaptability between the people involved.  </p>

            </div>
            </div>
                <p>During my college years I was fortunate enough to have a part-time job at Disneyland. I was in Attractions and hired into the It's a Bug's Life theatre show (RIP). After the theater shut down I joined the legendary Tow-Mater at his Junkyard Jamboree. Months later I experienced the fast-paced (but extremely rewarding) position at Monstropolis. My time at Disney was wonderful and something I look back on fondly.</p>

                    </div>
                <p>The picture of me above was actually infront of one of the Yonsei school buildings! I took an extra year with school because I was so adamant that I wanted to study abroad. And I'm very happy I did because spending time in Korea was one of the best experiences of my life! I miss everything about it: the food, the culture, the transportation system... God, I miss those subways.</p>

                    </div>
                    </div>
                <p>I'm a firm believer that cartoons are not just for children. I would argue that (especially recently) many of the stories told through animation can be appreciated by older audiences. But sometimes it doesn't have to be. Sometimes you just want to sit back and watch an old episode of Spongebob cuz its funny.</p>

                <p>Another fun fact is that I also like K-Pop. My favorite group is SHINee and they released and album this year after 3 years. It's brilliant and I recommend it!</p>
                <p>If you're not into K-Pop there were also some great albums released in 2020, a majority of which (in my opnion) were realeased by female artists: Rina Sawayama, ChloexHalle, Miley Cyrus, etc.</p>
                <p>Also included are some some songs from 2019 from Doja Cat's and Tinashe's albums. Those albums are...iconic. Like, truly. And of course there's 'WAP'. Because obviously.</p>
