As someone who spent a lot of time binge watching TV shows and movies (as most people did in 2020), I thought it would be interesting to see which service was the most loathed, run evaluations and tests to figure out why, decipher possible solutions, and implement these solutions in a redesign.</p>

                                    <p class="section-content">If the 2020 pandemic has taught us anything (aside from literally everything it could have taught us), it is that video streaming platforms have become almost a necessity for everyday users. In the first half of 2020, Netflix added 25 million new subscribers, increasing their already enormous subscriber base (195 million!). It is no surprise then, that more video streaming platforms have continued to launch over the past year, competing for users to join their subscriptions instead. Since 2019, we’ve already been given Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max, Peacock, Discovery+, Quibi and more. </p>
                                    <p class="section-content">With so many platforms to choose from, companies need to give users what they want. Which is two things: Quality content and a memorable user experience. And since I am a UX Designer, I’m inclined to focus on the latter.</p>
                                    <p class="section-content">So the question I need to ask is this: Which streaming platform has the worst user experience?</p>
                                    <p class="section-content">Now, this question may be a little harder to answer, because a quick Google search will send you to various articles and Reddit comments stating that Hulu is the worst or that Prime can’t get it together or that Apple TV is a headache to use. And while I do believe that all of these platforms have UX issues that should have been solved ages ago and I have my own platform issues (Disney+, I’m looking at you), there was one service that continued to pop up.</p>

                                    <p class="section-content">HBO Max launched on May 27, 2020, making this service only a little over a year old (at the time of me writing this). The service is owned by WarnerMedia and as of April 2021 has 63.9 million subscribers worldwide.</p>
                                    <p class="section-content">When launched, the service was met with mixed reception. HBO Max only achieved 26.6 million subscribers within it’s first month which paled in comparison to Disney+’s 10 million in the first day. </p>
                                    <p class="section-content">Despite this, however, HBO Max was still well received due to it’s extensive content list on the platform. WarnerMedia has acquired various content providers for the site, including HBO, DC Entertainment, Warner Bros and more.</p>
                                    <p class="section-content">Personally, I do find myself reaching for HBO Max the most out of my 4 other subscriptions. HBO Max has The Nanny. There’s no competition. However, I was surprised to find from my extensive Google search (all of 5 minutes of it) is that the most common feedback that the service has received is that it has “quality content but sh*tty UI”. </p>
                                    <p class="section-content">This is never a good thing to say about a streaming service. While the content will have users returning to the platform, eventually the terrible experience and constant frustration over the inability to do simple tasks will have users cancelling subscriptions.</p>
                                    <p class="section-content">So what does this mean for HBO Max? Let’s take a UX deep dive into the platform’s TV interface and see what we can do to help the platform.</p>

                                <p>Both HBO Max and Netflix are major streaming platforms with one of the major differences (aside from UI and content) is that Netflix has been in the streaming game for almost 10 years and Max only came out about a year ago. This means that Netflix has had the time to play around with their UI and improve their UX. This is very clear when users log in because they are instantly met with content and suggestions that send users down binge-watching rabbit holes. HBO Max can’t really relate.</p>

                          <div class="row justify-content-center">
                              <div class="col-md-10">
                                  <div>
                                    <h4 class="sub-section-title" style="text-transform: none; margin-top: 25px" >Problem Addressed</h4>
                                    <p>One of HBO Max’s major issues is that it’s not clear to users where they are in the moment. When you scroll through the different titles, a highlight surrounds the title you are currently on. This isn’t a major problem but can create issues when you start scrolling quickly and your eyes start to glaze over. Netflix doesn’t have this problem. When users perform this exact same action on Netflix, they are notified of the title they are currently on and more. Landing on a title not only highlights it, but the top half of the screen is dedicated to showing the title name with a plot summary, cast info, and uses either a clip or a shot of the title as a background. This holds onto users’ attentions. It’s basically a giant advertisement sign and tells users exactly what they just landed on. </p>
                                    <p>Netflix also has an all around way better video player UI. Hands down. When paused, HBO Max only has a pause/play button. Netflix has that but also allows you to adjust audio options which is way more convenient than having to exit, adjust, then play again.</p>

                                <h4 class="sub-section-title" style="text-transform: none; margin-top: 25px" >Feature Set</h4>
                                <p>Both streaming platforms have similar basic layouts. When you log in, users are welcomed with a profile selection page, which then takes you to a main page with movie/show titles in different categories. The layouts are quite similar, however a major difference is Netflix’s use of video clips that can take up a portion of the screen. When the clip is not in use, both services show about 2 rows of categories with titles. They also share the vertical, left sided toolbar that some services have. Netflix and HBO Max both create their own content for their services, but Netflix does a much better job at advertising by being more interactive. Clips of their originals are played for users when they hover over them, which can create interest. HBO Max does the minimum by placing their originals in a designated category and that’s it. </p>

                                <p>Disney+ is only about 2 years older than HBO Max, which means it should have a better UX since it’s had some time to adjust and grow. This isn’t exactly the case 100% (I will go as far as saying that Disney+ actually has the worst UX but that’s a case study for another day), however Disney+ and HBO Max can both learn a little from each other.</p>

                                    <p>HBO Max has Hubs. Don't know what Hubs are? Neither did I until I started clicking around on the service. Hubs are the different channels from which a lot of the content that is on the service comes from: Cartoon Network, DC Comics, Crunchyroll, etc. This is not advertised or even hinted at on the service at all. Unless you scroll all the way to the bottom of the landing page, you won't see the list of different channels. Or if you go to the toolbar and decide to click on Hubs (but first time users may not know what this is at all because it doesn't describe it anywhere). Disney+ had it’s own “Hubs” but it does a much better job at showing it to users. At the top of the landing page, users have the option to navigate to Marvel, Star Wars or National Geographic and browse the content within those “Hubs”. The way they are displayed isn't even very flashy like Netflix highlighting originals. It’s the fact that users can immediately see it and have the option to go to these spaces to find specific titles. HBO Max acts as if their Hubs don't exist when they should be shoving it down users’ throats. By advertising small spaces of recognizable content, users can seek specific titles that will make them excited about using the service.</p>
                                  <p>Disney+ doesn't do a lot right (once again, that’s for a different day), but their movie/show info pages are quite wonderful. They are similar to Netflix, clearly displaying actions and providing detailed and helpful description. Disney+ also utilizes it’s space very well on these pages. There's not awkward empty space and it look very pleasing. HBO Max, is the opposite. They have a lot of empty space and the actions/descriptions look more appropriate for their mobile app than their TV UI.</p>

                                <p>Like Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max have similar basic layouts: profile pages intro, scrolling landing page, vertical left-sided toolbar. Their video player is also quite similar, although Disney’s is slightly worse on Roku devices when it come’s to forwarding/rewinding. Disney+ has a screen sharing feature that HBO Max and many other services do not have. This was definitely a very defining feature for 2020 with social distancing enforcements, so well done for Disney. As mentioned before, the feature that they share the most in common are the “Hubs” that both services offer to viewers. Rather than throwing users into an ocean of content categorized by “Girl’s Night Out” or “Family Friendly”, having these “Hubs” allow users to browse specific content from channels/universes that they have pre-existing interest in.</p>

                                            <p>Completing the cognitive walkthrough allowed me to be completely aware of my actions and the feedback provided by HBO Max for the very first time. An app that once seemed simple when I passively scrolled through, now had glaring issues that I can no longer over look.</p>
                                            <p>One of the major concerns I discovered, was the lack of options/actions when it came to the video player. I can only really pause/play the video and fast forward/rewind but only when the video is playing. So if I try to complete those actions on a paused video, I’m not even given the option. This was quite interesting, and the lack of actions is also glaring when on an app like Netflix, I have the power to do all of that, as well as change languages and subtitles and skip to next episodes on a series. I’m not even entirely sure where I’m allowed to change languages on HBO Max or if the app supports it.</p>
                                            <p>Another prominent issue was the very subtle feedback I would get from the app. When you move around, the app notifies you by having a surrounding halo in the Max color scheme. But sometimes I moved so quick and the halo was so subtle that I had to pause and let my eyes find my current location. A similar issue arises when I scroll down on a title’s information page but the scrolling doesn’t snap down to display the whole information. I’ll scroll down and I’ll land on Season 1 of a series but the episodes don’t display on my screen. I then need to click down once more to see everything. That seems a little dumb and like the app should just show me everything once I’m in a new “area”.</p>

                              <p>I’ve decided to conduct a heuristic evaluation last  to test HBO Max’s usability with a set of criteria that can pinpoint specific flaws in the system.

This evaluation will allow me to focus on specific issues and pinpoint their impact on the overall UX. After the evaluation, I hope to have more insight into possible redesign targets.</p>

                                    <p>When users scroll through clickable items, the site notifies users either by having a highlight around it or filling it in with a purple gradient. This notifies users where there cursor currently is. However, non-clickable selections are not given the same attention, which can lead to confusion as to where users are on the system. Sometimes the status on the screen is also not immediately recognizable, it should be more overt.</p>

                                        <p>On movie/show pages, HBO Max relies more on symbols (play, plus sign, and a little movie icon) to indicate users of actions. These symbols are quite universal so anyone with experience using streaming services should know what it means. Complete newbies will have to play around to understand. The language used to label and categorize items are mostly the same as other services.</p>

Something this simple should be an option from the exact account you are on. The system allows you to clear out your Recently Watched on your own which is something I actually thought was very interesting.

Titles on the landing page are all vertical and tall, but when you browse through Last Chance, the titles are horizontal and short. They should all look the same. The horizontal should be saved for trailers or TV episodes. Also, I originally thought carousels were not used to showcase titles, but it is used only in Coming Soon. Landing pages should have the similar features and layouts in order to be consistent through out. </p>

                                                        <p>One of the most pervasive issues HBO Max has is that their Hubs are not well-advertised on their service. Hubs is an option to click on their toolbar, but users may not be aware of what it does. The service should provide more context on their landing page to have users recognize their Hubs. The trailer icon on content pages is also not the most obvious because it unclear to users what it is. I thought it was a cast button for the longest time. Overall though, Max does well at providing action and categories that users can recognize and realize are similar to other services.</p>

                                                            <p>The landing page has Continue Watching and My List categories at the very top for users to quickly jump back into what they are watching. I think the list of genres on their Movie and Series pages can be done a bit more efficiently, as of now you have to scroll through a giant list to find the genre you want to look for. I don't think this would be a major problem if the pages had other categories to scroll through rather than just a bunch of random titles.</p>
                                                            <p>Also the closed captions option is not accessible from the title content page or when the title is playing. Users need to go to their icon in order to change it, which seems like too much work and not something intuitive. Users should be able to adjust that (and audio options!) right as they play their title.</p>

The layout is inconsistent through out the app however and also can create wasted space. I think the layout tries so hard to be minimal that it wastes the space that could be utilized on these larger TV screens.</p>

                                    <p>The feedback on some features were to subtle. New users need more in your face information to let them know that what they did went through. They want the screen to talk back to them. When users go scroll through the different titles on the app, it is very easy to lose your place and get cross-eyed. When scrolling down within a title, HBO Max also has a bad habit of not snap scrolling to the new tab. When users scroll down to switch between seasons, the episodes of the season should be visible.</p>

                                        <p>First time users do not know what Hubs are—I didn’t know what a Hub was until I did this project. Hubs shouldn't be as hidden as they are (all the way at the bottom or in a tab people may not know the meaning of). No other streaming service offers HBO, Cartoon Network and Crunchyroll all in one space. These features should be flaunted! As well, as Max’s original series. They have an abundance of content that they should be promoting but are not. </p>

                                        <p>The movie detail pages, as well as the special highlights on the homepage are the worst offenders of having to much open space on this app. TVs offer more space than phones and desktops and that should be more taken advantage of. The descriptions for films can also be bulked up more, which will help with the spacing. Probably more of a UX writing problem, but still something that can be fixed. Users shouldn't have to look up what a movie is about on their phone.</p>

                                      <p>The redesign keeps the original color palette and overall aesthetic of the orginal. Notable additions is using banner carousels at the top in order to promote more content to users. This is similar to the one on their desktop app. Hubs have also been moved to the top instead of the bottom in order to better promote the different 'channels' on the app. Paramount+ and Disney+ have a similar layout that better advertises their own 'Hubs'.</p>

                                        <p>I replaced the left side menu bar with only the circular icon in the top left corner in order to create more space. Users can can still access the bar by moving to the icon as they would have previously and the bar will appear with different navigational options.</p>
                                        <p>Titles still have the highlight around them when landed on, but are now also slightly enlarged so users know what title they are on at all times. When hovered on, a pop up appears with a small movie description and a GIF or clip playing to preview the movie. This may entice users to press play and increase their time on the app.</p>

                                          <p>There isn’t too much of a difference in the Title Info Page. I mostly wanted to make use of the space by making a more detailed description and adding actors to intrigue users. The original page was vague and had me pulling out my phone to learn more of the movie. This solves that issue. A “Like” and “Audio” button were also added to create a more customized experience for users.</p>
                                          <p>When paused, the Video Player now allows users to restart the title and choose different audio/subtitle options easily. Very similar to Netflix, while still keeping the Max aesthetic.</p>

                                          <p>HBO Max doesn’t have proper scroll and snaps. This is an example of how it should look like. When the user scrolls to a new section it should immediately show it’s content and not just have it cut off so you can’t see the whole thing. In this case, we can see that we are now clearly on the Extras tab.</p>
                                          <p>
                                              Tabs were added to separate sections rather than having users scrolling down. And for TV shows, the seasons are shown in a vertical list rather than the horizontal tabs they had before. This allows for easier navigation, as well as keeps the other tabs to explore more content.</p>

                                            <p>This is a fun little feature I decided to add that also highlights a way to make better use of space on the homepage. Initially, this type of layout wasted space with small, uninformative descriptors as well as having cropped images that looked out of place. The way I rearranged and added to the layout allows it to be eye-catching to users, but not overwhelming. </p>
                                            <p>The quiz is simple new feature and is mainly intended to gather information from the user as well a way to have the user stay on the app longer. It is interactive and personable, which may appeal to some users. Having a quiz gives them something to do after endlessly scrolling and searching for content, and then prompts them to stay on the app to watch the suggestions.</p>

                                                        <p>So, let’s get straight into it. Is HBO Max the worst streaming platform?</p>
                                                        <p>Yes and no.</p>
                                                        <p>For a company as large and affluent as HBO and Warner Media, one would expect an an enjoyable, easy and innovative experience on the app. But that’s not the case. Using the HBO Max streaming service is a challenge and it shouldn't be. Users have expressed frustrations navigating the app and have criticized the platform’s display. While one may make excuses that the service has been around for less than two years, knowing how competitive the streaming market is and the wealth of it’s parent company, makes it a pathetic first attempt at streaming.</p>
                                                        <p>That said, the app shows an amazing amount of potential! As stated before, HBO Max has some of the best content (both original and from other networks) on the streaming service market. And while that is enough to reel in users to the app, it may not be enough to hold onto them. That is why HBO Max is in desperate need of a UX/UI makeover.</p>
                                                        <p>In this case study, I targeted and analyzed HBO Max’s problem areas and then came up with four targets that became the focus of my redesign. I wanted the redesign to focus on: highlighting special features, making use of the open space that TV apps allow, making actions and feedback clear to users, and creating a more personalized experience. With these four targets in mind, I redesigned several parts of the HBO Max Roku app. My goal was to redesign these pages to reflect these targets, while still staying true to the HBO Max brand. I believe these redesigns—while they are not a finalized version—stay true to the brand and achieve my goals.</p>
                                                        <p>Is there anything I would have done differently? Yes! Something that is quite common in the world of computer science and UX is to “borrow”. And something I wanted to “borrow” (and I think that every service should “borrow”) is the Amazon prime feature that shows the actors and their past works—basically a mini IMDB. It’s such a wonderful feature, and since HBO Max is owned by Warner Media, which is a subset of Warner Studio who is a Goliath in the movie industry, it makes sense to have a feature like this. I would want to incorporate this next time, for sure!</p>
                                                        <p>In conclusion, HBO Max still has a long way to go before becoming the #1 streaming service, but that is a possibility not too far in the future. If HBO Max can get it’s UX and UI together, it can easily dethrone the major streaming services that have been in the game for years.</p>
